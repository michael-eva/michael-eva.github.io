    	<h3>Cattai Camp Grounds</h3>
    	<p id="date">2 January 2017</p>

    	<p>Cattai Camp Grounds is situated inside Cattai National Park which is about an hour's drive northwest of Sydney. The campground is fairly large - accommodating around 80 tents at any one time. Half of the grounds are reserved for day visitors where overnight camping is not permitted. There are electric barbeques in the day visitors section while there are designated fire areas in the camping section. The Hawkesbury River runs next to the campsite offering magnificent views of the water and the Kangaroo trails running just outside of the camping grounds offer sights and sounds that have been unspoiled by human intervention.</p>

    	<h3>Day 1:</h3>

    	<p>Day 1 saw us pitching the tent and setting up, swimming in the Hawkesbury river, exploring Kangaroo paths and playing card games.</p>

    	<p>Pitching the tent took far longer than expected even though we practiced setting up the tent beforehand. The first time we set up the tent, we did a half-ass job since one of us had too much to drink during the New Yearâ€™s celebrations and was really feeling it the next day as well as it being boiling hot outside.</p>

       	<p>After everything was set up, we decided it was time to start exploring. We started out by trying to find a place where we could climb into the river since the river bank was very steep and covered in mangroves. We found a nice entrance into the river but we later found out that it was the most popular spot for the campers to climb into the water since it was the most accessible. We climbed into our bathers and jumped into the water, amazed at how warm the water was.</p>

    	<p>Later on in the day we went for a walk around the campsite and we came across these tracks that lead into the bush. Being the adventurous people that we are, we started walking along these paths to try and see where they ended up. We agreed to walk along "just for a little while" since we had no water with us or a phone to get help if we got lost but the more we walked and explored, the more we wanted to walk and explore. The scenery looked like nobody had ever sat foot there and was completely free of human intervention. The tracks were overgrown and looked like they were made for really small people since they were very narrow. It turns out that these paths were made by Kangaroos to move between where they slept and where they were feeding.</p>

    	<h3>Day 2:</h3>

    	<p>Day 2 found us swimming in the river and exploring the historical buildings within the Cattai National Park.</p>

    	<p>Waking up after our first night, we were amazed at how many Kangaroos we spotted during the night and in the morning. We ate a healthy serving of Nutri-Grain in preparation for the day ahead.</p>

    	<p>We climbed into the river for a relaxing swim and spent about an hour in there!</p>

        <img class="river-swimming"src="michael-eva.github.io/images/DSC01203.JPG">

    	<p>In the National Park lies the Arndell family homestead - which is heritage listed - who lived there for 7 generations farming crops and sheep. Thomas Arndell came to Australia from England as an assistant surgeon on the first fleet. On his homestead, he was ordered to start growing corn and raising sheep. The homestead was built in the 1820's and the stone mill is thought to be the oldest industrial building in Australia. We learnt that Australia is now the largest producer of wool in the world thanks to the Arndell's for breeding sheep that would bare good quality wool.</p>

    	<p>We started building our own fires today using only wood and kindling we found at the campsite. We must have looked like amateurs since the people who were cooking next to us offered us wood and coal for our fire!</p>

    	<h3>Day 3:</h3>

    	<p>On our final full day of camping, we explored the surrounding region of Wiseman's Ferry and spotted a Kangaroo in the bush with a little Joey in her pouch.</p>

    	<p>Wiseman's Ferry is about a 30 minute drive from the Cattai National Park sporting magnificent views and gorgeous winding roads. We crossed over the Hawkesbury river in a car-carrying ferry which is free because it's part of the road and went for a drive to St Albans where we heard about an amazing little restaurant called The Fickle Wombat. As it turns out, the restaurant was closed that day, so we turned around and headed back to the ferry.</p>

    	<p>We stopped a cute little river beach where we wanted to swim but there were a few people fishing there, so we decided against it. We played cricket and rode on the swinging see-saw instead.</p>


    	<p>Upon returning to the camp ground, we found a walking path that lead to a river lookout. On the walk, we spotted a mother Kangaroo with a Joey in her pouch. It was amazing seeing a Kangaroo in the bush like that as we had never seen one like that before.</p>

    	<p>On our final night, we grabbed a few beers and headed to the wharf to watch the sunset since the sky was clearer than the previous 2 nights. We had an amazing time twerking on the wharf and watching the sunset. It was the perfect last night, we couldn't have asked for it to be any better.</p>

    	<h3>Day 4:</h3>

    	<p>Day 4 started out really well with an amazing breakfast - eggs, toast and tinned spaghetti. It was so nice having warm food to begin the rather gloomy day.</p>

    	<p>Packing up was made difficult for us by the unrelenting rain. It didn't rain particularly hard, but because we had no shelter while packing up, we were soaked by the end of it. We had a good time nonetheless and added an extra element of adventure to our trip!</p>
